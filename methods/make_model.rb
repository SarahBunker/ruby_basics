# Using the following code, write a method called car that takes two arguments and prints a string containing the values of both arguments.

def car(make, model)
  puts "#{make} #{model}"
end

car('Toyota', 'Corolla')

=begin

there use this code means that is how they want you to invocate the method
so..
needed the print inside the method

further exploration wants it with puts on the outside and no puts on the inside how I first wrote it.
