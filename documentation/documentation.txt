##############################
where to find documentation

core API is stuff you can use without importing
  object, string, array..

Standard library API
  available classes and modules
  must be imported into program
    import using require
  Classes
  Set
  Date
  JSON
  YAML
  
  Modules
  Singleton
  Find
  
No separate section for just the language
  look for new to ruby links > couldn't find > found
  ruby-doc.org
    
  
#####################################
While loops

Select the core API link for your version of ruby.
Select the "control expressions" link.
Search within the page for "while" until you find the "while loop" discussion.

# Finding while from docs.ruby_lang.org
I like going to the pages tab to be able to search for topics like this
#

#########################
Return Value of while

A while loop returns nill unless there is a break statement inside the while loop

################
Return value of break

------------------
result = [1, 2, 3].each do |value|
  break value * 2 if value.even?
end

p result # prints 4
------------------

you can give a value to break to return when breaking

while loops return nil unless break is given value
if break is given an expression it returns the value of that expression
if break is not given an expression it returns nil

could also find this out using irb or ruby program

##############
Large Numbers

stuff on numbers is found in literals
1234 = 1_234 = 1.234E3
you can place an underscore anywhere in a number
It can be used to increase readability, using like commas
You can use an _ in floating point numbers as well
1.234_567

#################
Symbol Syntax
still on literals page

I would create a symbol using a colon like this

##############
String Classes
classes are on the main page, then go to the classes tab, then searched for string

on ruby-doc.org you can get there by
  from the core page go to the classes tab in the upper left corner
  then use the search on the top bar, search for string
  
if you are on the specific 2.6.3
  then on the main api core you can scroll down to the class
  use the filter
  and select string
  
two types of methods
  instance
    instance will have a # at the start
    this is what we use a lot in the start of the class
  class
    class methods have a :: at the start
    we will use these more later
  # and :: just show what type of method they are, they are not needed to call the method anyway
  launch school material will also use this.

#############
Right Justifying Strings

rjust(integer,padstr='') > new string
  returns a new string with str righ justified and padded with padstr

YAML::load_file

load_file(filepath) ~ loads a documents from the file located at the file path

require 'yaml'
MESSAGES = YAML.load_file('calculator_messages.yml')

this yaml was in the same folder as the calculator problem so I could just write it as the file name
